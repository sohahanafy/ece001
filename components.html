A database consists of:

<h3>Database structure</h3> Conceived as a single entity consisting of a collection of interrelated files.
<h3>Repository</h3>	Includes the rules under which users can access the data and the rules under which the data is organized, i.e. the metadata.
<h3>End users</h3> Who have access to the database.
<h3>Interfaces</h3>	Which are the various ways that end-users can access data via display terminals, remote terminal phone links, touch screens, bar code readers, voice commands, touchpads, graphics selection, keyboard, or mouse menu selections, command keys or card scanning. The interface is also the form in which the information is provided to the end-user, e.g. a graph, a printed report, graphical display.
<h3>Application programs</h3>	Used to perform main operations on data, i.e. create, alter, delete, and retrieve. Application programs also combine data in a meaningful way to produce reports
<h3>Database Management System (DBMS)</h3>	A collection of programs that manage the database structure and interpret the repository rules as well as manage user access in multi-user systems.
<h3>Computer Aided Software Engineering Tools (CASE tools)</h3>	 are also known as part of the database system. These are automated tools to assist in the design of systems and databases.
<h3>Database Administrators (DBA)</h3>Manage the DBMS and are responsible for the organization 's overall information resources. In a later section, you will look more fully at the role of the DBA.
<h3>System Developers</h3>	Include system analysts and programmers. You 're going to look at the function of each of these in other modules. Both use CASE tools to help develop application programs.
