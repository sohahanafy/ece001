The database and database management systems have become an integral part of every kind of work, whether in managing business-related data or managing our household accounts. The purpose of this paper is to take a look back in time and track the origin of the database, its development over the years, and to take a look forward at what the future may hold for databases.</p>

<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> HISTORY OF DATA BASE </h2>
  The origins of the database go back to libraries,  governmental,  business, and medical records before the computers were invented  (Date,  2003).  Once people realized they needed to have the means to store data and maintain the data files for later retrieval, they were trying to find ways to store, index, and retrieve data. With the emergence of computers, the world of the database changed rapidly,  making it an easy,  cost-effective, and less space-consuming task to collect and maintain the database. </p>
