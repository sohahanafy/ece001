Database and database management systems have become an integral part of any kind of function, whether in managing business-related data or in managing our household accounts. The purpose of this paper is to look back in time and trace the roots of the database, its evolution over the years, and to look forward to what the future holds for the databases.</p>

<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> HISTORY OF DATA BASE </h2>
  The roots of the database go back to the libraries, government, business, and medical records before the machines were invented (Date, 2003). Once people realized that they needed the means to store data and maintain data files for later retrieval, they were trying to find ways to store the data,
Index, and get the data back. Since the advent of computers, the database world has changed rapidly, making it easy, cost-effective and less space-consuming to collect and maintain a database.
