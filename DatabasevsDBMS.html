<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Summary:</H2>
 Because of the many problems inherent in the piecemeal approach, it is nowadays considered desirable to maintain a single, ideally centralized pool of
organizational data, rather than a series of separate files. Such a pool of data is
known as a database.
It is also considered desirable to integrate the systems that use this data
around a piece of software that manages all interactions with the database.
Such a piece of software is known as a database management system or
DBMS.
A database in manual terms is analogous to a filing cabinet, or more accurately to a series of filing cabinets. A database is a structured repository for data.
The overall purpose of such a repository is to maintain data for some set of
organizational objectives. Traditionally, such objectives fall within the domain
of administration. Most database systems are built to retain the data required
for the running of the day-to-day activities of an organization. Hence, in a
university, a database system will be needed for such activities as recording
assessments of students on modules.
Structure normally implies some logical division, usually hierarchical. Hence
we speak of a database as being a collection of data structures. A collection of
data structures containing information on students at a university, for
instance, would normally constitute a database. Each data structure in a database is in turn also a hierarchical collection of data. In manual terms, such data
structures would be folders hung in a filing cabinet. Each folder in the cabinet
consists of a series of cards of information, for example, on each student. Each
card is further divided into a series of data items such as StudentNo,
StudentName, DateOfBirth etc. Within each data-item, a specific value is written.


<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Database</h2>
A database is a collection of data organized in a manner that allows access, retrieval, and use of that data. Data is a collection of unprocessed items, which can include text, numbers, images, audio, and video. Information is processed data; that is, it is organized, meaningful, and useful.

Computers process data in a database into information. A database at a school, for example, contains data about students, e.g., student data, class data, etc. A computer at the school processes new student data and then sends advising appointment and ID card information to the printers.

<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> DBMS</h2>
With database software, often called a database management system (DBMS), users create a computerized database; add, modify, and delete data in the database; sort and retrieve data from the database; and create forms and reports from the data in the database. Database software includes many powerful features.
