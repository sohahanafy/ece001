<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Summary:</H2>
 Due to the many problems inherent in the piecemeal approach, it is now considered desirable to maintain a single, ideally centralized pool of organizational data rather than a series of separate files. Such a data set is known as a database. It is also considered beneficial to integrate the applications that use this data into a piece of software that handles all communications with the database. Such a piece of software is known as a DBMS or a database management system. The database, in manual terms, is analogous to a filing cabinet or, more precisely, to a series of filing cabinets. The database is a structured data repository.
The ultimate purpose of such a repository is to preserve data for a set of organizational objectives. Traditionally, these objectives fall within the domain of administration. Most of the database systems are designed to retain the data needed to run the day-to-day activities of the organization. A database system would, therefore, be required in a university for activities such as recording student evaluations on modules. Structure normally involves some logical division, usually hierarchical. And we're talking about a database as a set of data structures. Set of data structures containing information on students at a university, for example, It will normally constitute a database.   Each data structure in the database, in effect, is also a hierarchical data set. Manually, these data structures will be files hanging in a filing cabinet. Each folder in the cabinet consists of a series of information cards, for example, for each student. Every card is further divided into several data items such as StudentNo, StudentName, DateOfBirth, etc. A particular value is written within each data object.



<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Database</h2>
The database is a collection of data organized in such a way as to allow access, retrieval, and use of that data. Data is a set of unprocessed objects that may include text, numbers, images, audio, and video. Information is processed data; that is to say, it is organized, meaningful, and useful. Computers are storing data into information in a database. For example, a school database includes student data, e.g. student data, class data, etc. The school computer processes new student data and then sends advice on appointment and ID card information to the printers.

Computers process data in a database into information. A database at a school, for example, contains data about students, e.g., student data, class data, etc. A computer at the school processes new student data and then sends advising appointment and ID card information to the printers.

<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> DBMS</h2>
Using database software, also referred to as a database management system ( DBMS), users create a computerized database; add, change and delete data in the database; sort and remove data from the database; and produce forms and reports from the data in the database. Database software has many powerful features.
