A database can be defined as a shared collection of interrelated data designed to meet the organization's varied information needs. (The McFadden and the Hoffer). 

<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Properties </h2>

<h2>A database is</h2>

<h3>Integral</h3>	Previously distinct data files have been logically organized to eliminate or reduce redundancy and facilitate data access
<h3>Shared</h3>	All eligible participants of an organization have access to the same data for use in a variety of activities. 
<h3>Interrelated</h3>	Structured in a manner that is logically meaningful to the organization. 

<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Advantages </h2>

There are a range of benefits to the approach to the database. These are discussed in more depth in the topic of Database Systems. There are some of the advantages of a database system

<h3>Data management</h3>	The DBMS provides a mechanism for facilitating the management of the data held by the organization. 
<h3>Data independence</h3>	Data is stored in a database system independently of the application programs that use it. Changes to the data or how it is stored will not necessarily affect the programs that use the data. 
<h3>Data consistency</h3>	The database system is designed to minimize redundancy. Ideally, data items are stored only in one location. When data updates are made, adjustments should only be made to this one spot. This significantly improves the consistency of the database test results.
<h3>Data sharing</h3>	Data collection in a central data repository and managed by DBMS enables the sharing of data by several users and applications. 
<h3>Increased productivity</h3>File structures are already established in the database structure. New application programs that use these frameworks can then be created. This results in a shorter period of growth. 
<h3>Reduced maintenance</h3>	A range of tools for data maintenance has already been built into the majority of DBMS. Tools can include report generators, query languages, type generators, code tests, data dictionaries, and maintenance logs.
