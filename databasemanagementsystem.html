<p>The Database Management System ( DBMS) is a system software for the creation and management of databases. The DBMS enables end-users to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. The most prevalent type of data management platform, DBMS, essentially serves as an interface between databases and end-users or application programs, ensuring that data is organized consistently and remains easily accessible.
<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Functions of a DBMS</H2>
The DBMS manages three important things: the data, the database engine that allows the data to be accessed, locked and modified, and the database schema that defines the logical structure of the database. These three basic elements help to ensure consistency, security, data integrity, and consistency in data management procedures. Typical DBMS-supported database management tasks include change management, performance monitoring and tuning, security, and backup and recovery. Many database management systems are also responsible for automated rollbacks and restarts, as well as logging and auditing activities in databases.
DBMS may be most useful for providing a centralized view of data that can be accessed by multiple users from multiple locations in a controlled manner. DBMS can limit what data the end-user sees, as well as how the end-user can view the data, providing a wide range of views of a single database schema. End users and software programs are exempt from the need to understand where the data is physically located or what form of storage media it resides as the DBMS manages all requests.
DBMS can offer both logical and physical data independence. This means that it can protect users and applications from the need to know where the data is stored or to be concerned about changes in the physical structure of the data. As long as applications use the Application Programming Interface (API) for the database provided by the DBMS, developers do not have to modify programs simply because improvements have been made to the database.

In the relational database management system ( RDBMS), the most widely used type of DBMS, this API is SQL, the standard programming language for defining, protecting, and accessing data in the RDBMS.

<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Popular database models and management systems include:</h2>

<p>Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)—adaptable to most use cases, but RDBMS Tier-1 products can be very costly.</p>
<p>NoSQL DBMS — Suitable for loosely defined data structures that can develop over time.</p>
<p>In-memory Database Management System (IMDBMS)—provides faster response times and improved performance.</p>
<p>Columnar Database Management System (DBMS)—Suitable for data warehouses with a large number of similar data items.</p>
<p>Cloud-based database management system — Cloud service provider is responsible for providing and maintaining DBMS.</p>

<h2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Advantages of using a DBMS</h2>

<p>Using DBMS to store and manage data comes with benefits, but also overhead operation. One of the biggest advantages of using DBMS is that it allows end-users and application programmers to access and use the same data while managing data integrity. Data is better protected and maintained when it can be shared with DBMS instead of creating new iterations of the same data stored in new files for each new application. The DBMS provides a central data store that can be accessed by multiple users in a controlled manner.</p>
<b>Central storage and management of data within the DBMS provides:</b>
<p>Data abstraction and independence.</p>
<p>Data security.</p>
<p>A locking mechanism for concurrent access.</p>
<p>An efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data.</p>
<p>The ability to swiftly recover from crashes and errors, including restartability and recoverability.</p>
<p>Robust data integrity capabilities.
<p>Logging and auditing of activity.
<p>Simple access using a standard API.</P>
<p>Uniform administration procedures for data.</p>

<H2><span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9830;</span> Disadvantages of DBMS </H2>
The disadvantages of the database approach are summarized as follows:

<H3>1. Complexity </H3>: The provision of the functionality that is expected of a good DBMS makes the DBMS an extremely complex piece of software. Database designers, developers, database administrators and end-users must understand this functionality to take full advantage of it. Failure to understand the system can lead to bad design decisions, which can have serious consequences for an organization.

<h3>2. Size</h3> : The complexity and breadth of functionality makes the DBMS an extremely large piece of software, occupying many megabytes of disk space and requiring substantial amounts of memory to run efficiently.

<h3>3. Performance</h3>: Typically, a File Based system is written for a specific application, such as invoicing. As result, performance is generally very good. However, the DBMS is written to be more general, to cater for many applications rather than just one. The effect is that some applications may not run as fast as they used to.

<h3>4. Higher impact of a failure</h3>: The centralization of resources increases the vulnerability of the system. Since all users and applications rely on the ~vailabi1ity of the DBMS, the failure of any component can bring operations to a halt.

<h3>5. Cost of DBMS</h3>: The cost of DBMS varies significantly, depending on the environment and functionality provided. There is also the recurrent annual maintenance cost.

<h3>6. Additional Hardware costs</h3>: The disk storage requirements for the DBMS and the database may necessitate the purchase of additional storage space. Furthermore, to achieve the required performance it may be necessary to purchase a larger machine, perhaps even a machine dedicated to running the DBMS. The procurement of additional hardware results in further expenditure.

<h3>7. Cost of Conversion</h3>: In some situations, the cost oftlle DBMS and extra hardware may be insignificant compared with the cost of converting existing applications to run on the new DBMS and hardware. This cost also includes the cost of training staff to use these new systems and possibly the employment of specialist staff to help with conversion and running of the system. This cost is one of the main reasons why some organizations feel tied to their current systems and cannot switch to modern database technology.
